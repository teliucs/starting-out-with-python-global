# 7. Driver’s License Exam
# The local driver’s license office has asked you to create an application that grades the written
# portion of the driver’s license exam. The exam has 20 multiple-choice questions. Here
# are the correct answers:
    # 
# Your program should store these correct answers in a list. The program should read the
# student’s answers for each of the 20 questions from a text file and store the answers in
# another list. (Create your own text file to test the application.) After the student’s answers
# have been read from the file, the program should display a message indicating whether the
# student passed or failed the exam. (A student must correctly answer 15 of the 20 questions
# to pass the exam.) It should then display the total number of correctly answered questions,
# the total number of incorrectly answered questions, and a list showing the question numbers
# of the incorrectly answered questions.
