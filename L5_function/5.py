# 5 When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:

# d = 1/2 g t**2 

# The variables in the formula are as follows:  d  is the distance in meters,  g  is  9.8 , and  t  is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling. Write a function named falling_distance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that calls the function in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and displays the return value.
import math

def falling_distance(t):
    return (1/2) * 9.8 * (t**2)

def main():
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(f"The distance at {i} seconds is: {falling_distance(i):,.1f}.")

main()
