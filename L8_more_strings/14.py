# 14. Gas Prices
# In the student sample program files for this chapter, you will find a text file named
# GasPrices.txt. The file contains the weekly average prices for a gallon of gas in the
# United States, beginning on April 5th, 1993, and ending on August 26th, 2013. Figure 8-8
# shows an example of the first few lines of the file’s contents:

# Each line in the file contains the average price for a gallon of gas on a specific date. Each line
# is formatted in the following way:
# MM-DD-YYYY:Price
# MM is the two-digit month, DD is the two-digit day, and YYYY is the four-digit year. Price is
# the average price per gallon of gas on the specified date.
# For this assignment, you are to write one or more programs that read the contents of the file
# and perform the following calculations:
# Average Price Per Year: Calculate the average price of gas per year, for each year in the file.
# (The file’s data starts in April of 1993, and it ends in August 2013. Use the data that is present
# for the years 1993 and 2013.)
# Average Price Per Month: Calculate the average price for each month in the file.
# Highest and Lowest Prices Per Year: For each year in the file, determine the date and amount
# for the lowest price, and the highest price.
# List of Prices, Lowest to Highest: Generate a text file that lists the dates and prices, sorted
# from the lowest price to the highest.
# List of Prices, Highest to lowest: Generate a text file that lists the dates and prices, sorted
# from the highest price to the lowest.
# You can write one program to perform all of these calculations, or you can write di#erent
# programs, one for each calculation.

# I could not find that file.
# If you have it, let me know and I will try to solve this problem.
