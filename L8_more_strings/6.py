# 6. Average Number of Words
# If you have downloaded the source code from the Computer Science Portal you will find 
# a file named text.txt in the Chapter 08 folder. The text that is in the file is stored as one 
# sentence per line. Write a program that reads the fileâ€™s contents and calculates the average 
# number of words per sentence.
